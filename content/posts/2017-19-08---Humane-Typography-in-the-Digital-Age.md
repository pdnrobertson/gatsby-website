As I returned from a school camp up in the picturesque and fresh Alpine Region of Victoria, Australia, I found myself reflecting on the term that just passed. As a maths teacher I naturally lean towards numbers. In 10 weeks I have completed over 130 hours of teaching, and pulling on average 50 hours per week into planning/meetings/banging head against the wall. Add to the restless nights constantly thinking about my classes and students, reading up on pedagogy, university assignments, and the next rich task to inspire my students. So all up I put my total commitment to education and teaching to about 650 hours. But numbers only tell one part of the story.

This first post of mine is my foray into the world of education blogging by way of a reflection. I was inspired to do so after reading Craig Barton’s “How I Wish I’d Taught Maths”. Even if my students did not learn much in my 130 hours of teaching (how can I know), I now have 130 hours of insights. This post is a consolidation of my initial perspectives on various aspects of teaching and education, with some aspects heavily inspired by Craig’s book. I will be looking at:

* The Danger of a Single Story
* You Can Never Get Enough Support
* Students Remember What They Attend To
* The Curse of Knowledge
* Education Research is Messy

Here we go.

## The Danger of a Single Story

Early on in my teaching I watched a TED talk from Chimamanda Adichie. Whilst not directly related to education, the implications are significant and easily observable. The idea is that we often neatly categorise and create perceptions of people based on one or a limited set of experiences, or a single story. The person sleeping on the street and begging for money who needs to take responsibility for their life, or the student acting up in class has behavioural issues. However there is so much more to people, and kids. Their life cannot and should not be summarised based on a single impression.

I fell into this trap all too often early on, and to my credit a lesser extent as I progressed through the term. This fact really hit me when I was speaking to a student who was not submitting their homework, was always acting up in class and often refused to follow my instructions. The student began to cry. They confessed to me that they spend a lot of their time caring for their sick mother and siblings. They needed to work all the time to earn money to have food on the table. Maths was a low priority, and fair enough.

First impressions do last, but we cannot let that the be the single story that sums up each of our students. So to help this, I want to get to know more about all of my students. What hobbies do they have? What do they do outside of school? In the few cases where I have done this, my relationships with those students are stronger than ever.

## You Can Never Get Enough Support

For the sake of context, I’ll briefly describe my teaching journey. I am Associate if the Teach for Australia (TFA) program (equivalent to TeachFirst and Teach for America). For all the pros and cons of this style of teacher attraction and training (that’s for another day), there is one aspect which I believe makes the process worth it: support.

Whilst I don’t have immediate statistics on the issue, it’s certainly well known that lack of teacher support in pre-service and newly minted graduates is a major factor in teacher retention rates. Not only am I well supported by TFA, but the cohort of other Associates and friends has helped immensely. We celebrate our successes, and have solidarity in our struggles. We share ideas, provide advice and vent for catharsis when times are tough. Having a tightly knit community of people in the exact same situation as me has seen me through my toughest moments in the past 10 weeks.

I am also blessed with a wonderful group of colleagues at my school whose knowledge of the school, community and students helped me out in times of need, and provide the much needed pats-on-the-back with a timely “well done”.

## Students Remember What They Attend To

![](/media/inattentive-student.jpeg "Students remember what they attend to. Source: Demme Learning.")

The following three sections consist of some of my takeaways from Craig Barton’s book that I alluded to above. His findings codify a lot of what I experienced in my time in teaching.

> Students remember what they attend to.
>
> — Daniel Willingham

This quote from Daniel Willingham forms the basis for a lot of Craig’s conjectures. I interpret it as: if your students are only paying attention to me 50% of the time, then the theoretical maximum amount of things they remember is 50% (best case scenario).

This helps to explain a lot of the frustrations I experienced when I feel like I’ve explained a concept to a student half a dozen times and 5 seconds later they cannot recall a single thing. This relates to what I discussed earlier about the single story, in that there are probably so many other things going through the heads of the student as I’m talking. So it’s no surprise if they don’t take anything in.

## The Curse of Knowledge

![](/media/confused-student.jpeg "Students are novices, so we shouldn’t teach as though they are experts. Source: Redbrick Careers.")

At university I studied a degree in Science which incorporated chemistry, physics and mathematics, although maths is where my interest lies and was what I excelled at at school. Solving linear equations? Easy. Differentiation by First Principals? Could do it in my sleep. But when you break down these processes, there are a lot of steps going on. For me, these steps are committed to my long term memory and I can recall them automatically. This frees up cognitive space to solve complex problems that involve these skills. However when there is no automaticity, trying to solve problems and remember how to apply the skills is too much for the finite working memory of students. This is the curse of knowledge (Wiemann, 2007).

Relative to the students, I’m an expert in many domains of mathematics. I get maths. Yet, for all of my students (note all), they are novices. Sure, all of them come in with varying levels of domain-specific knowledge (often perceived as degrees of smartness or intelligence). Even something as simple as flipping a positive sign to negative can induce maths anxiety that makes learning impossible.

My key takeaway from this is to make sure that when I’m teaching a new concept, I break it down as much as possible. I research misconceptions so I can better anticipate where students might get confused. I’ll use minimally-different examples to carefully guide students through different scenarios, rather than assuming my novice students can handle it.

## Education Research is Messy

I never thought it was possible, but I am in love with everything to do with education. Seldom in my life have I experienced a drive to learn more, try different things, and embrace the chaos that teaching is. My foray into educational opinion and research however was far less rosy than I imagined. There is a lot of research out there, some good, some bad, and even those definitions are subject to context. There are lots of experts, and novices, and everyone has an opinion. Whilst I am all for the diversity in opinion and methods that I’ve seen, I can understand how heated discussion around education can be.

Throughout these 10 weeks my exploration has led me to various realms. From Hattie’s Visible Learning, Boaler and Dweck’s work on mindsets, to Ken Robinson’s orations. There seems to be a fine line between substantial and effective practice, and fad. I’ve wasted many a lesson following pedagogical rabbit holes. That isn’t to say that what I was trying to do wouldn’t have worked: it’s far more likely my implementation was at fault. However I am now far more cautious and critical about practices that I come across. Right now I’m exploring the field of cognitive science in education, and in particular the ideas surrounding Direct/Explicit Instruction, and so far this looks like a promising area. Stay tuned.

Thank you for giving up some of your time to read my 2 cents. I am very excited to continue my education journey and begin, and I am very keen to build my network of educators and teachers, so please do reach out. And to all the other Victorian teachers out there, enjoy yourself a well earned break (I know I will).
